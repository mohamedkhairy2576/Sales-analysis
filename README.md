Sales analysis for 7 countries.

I used Power BI.
I uploaded the CSV worksheet to Power Query.
I started with ETL.
I cleaned the data,
dealing with empty values, and duplicate values, making the data valid for analysis.
Then, using DAX, I created calculated columns.
I then started creating reports.
I used numerous charts to illustrate everything.
